The video is accelerated, this will take much longer...

If that doesn't work for you, you can install it manually.
Download [elArchivoPrincipal‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://sourceforge.net/projects/linuxoneclick/files/LOClicK.zip/download) with a download manager like JDownloader, Unzip it manually in C:/ and run the Installer.bat as shown in [ThisVideo‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1K3TLja434).


# üí¢Bug Fixes;

## Installer error;
[Use PowerShell Alternative‚¨áÔ∏è](https://razaoinfo.dl.sourceforge.net/project/linuxoneclick/LinuxInstall.ps1?viasf=1)

[Use PowerShell Alternative #2 ‚¨áÔ∏è](https://sitsa.dl.sourceforge.net/project/linuxoneclick/LinuxInstallAlternativa.ps1?viasf=1) This is slower, it can take up to 2H to Download.

## PowerShell Execution Policy Error;

If this appears, simply press the `O` key and then `ENTER` and the Script will be executed. (the confirmation key varies by language.)


## 2

You must open PowerShell manually and run this command, where what comes after `-File` is the location of the installer file (InstallLinuxMint.ps1)
```
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File F:\Downloads\LinuxMint\InstallLinuxMint.ps1
```

# üåå Change rEFInd theme;

Open `refind.confg` with a text editor and modify the last line with the folder name of your new theme.
